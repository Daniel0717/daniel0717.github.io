											<h4>Formality VS. Creativity</h4>
											<h5>People seem to believe that Formal and Creative writing are strict opposites.</h5>
										</header>
										<p>You know the pains of a high school English class. No, I’m not talking about the books we read; I’m talking about the responses we write: Essays, long-form, and likewise. This will most likely sound very familiar to you:</p>
										<ul>Third-person point of view only</ul>
                    <ul>Upmost formality, no informal diction</ul>
										<p>This set of English essay requirements was created with the prospect of teaching general students, going for any possible career path, how to write formal text. However, it doesn't take long for the students, whether writing the essay or reading it, to realize that this strict criteria is fairly lacking.</p>
										<p>The essays you write after the analysis of a text will almost always fall under the guise of Rhetoric, the art of persuasion. That makes sense, as the objective of these analytical essays are meant to persuade the reader of a standpoint of the text's theme. However, this objective cannot be accomplished through formality alone. Indeed, there must be a separation of the work from the creator. However, essays require another, deeper aspect that reflects the author and humanizes the viewpoint. This opens up the pathway that connects the text to the audience; through this, the audience is able to understand the text and accept the discussion.</p>
										<p>Most of the essays I've written in primary school required me to follow the criteria written above. At the time, I believed that this was the standard...Well, I believed it, grudgingly. Despite the positive grades (through following the criteria), these essays were lackluster.</p>
										<p>College, at first, was a shock, where writing took on a different approach. That different approach is a greater emphasis in the personalization of the essay. Much more than the regurgitation of information to pave a path, the criteria in college emphasize on the need to reflect on the information on a deeper level and develop real-world applicable theories supported by the text in focus. The rules are far more lenient, and one is able to speak in first-person, implement jokes and stylistic choices, and grab the engagement of the audience.</p>
										<p>I believe that there should be a fundamental shift in the way the high school English curriculum judge their students' essays. Not only to cultivate formality and accountability, the criteria should also account for an identifiable voice which builds upon the rhetorical effectiveness of the text. The common criteria of high school essay-writing leave this personalization out of focus, and that staunch formality restricts choices for greater rhetorical prowess. High school essays lack a human voice. Once again, people may argue for the formal criteria as the best means of raising general English literacy. I argue that formality and creativity do not have to be opposites; they should complement each other. The current method stifles innovation in English literacy and rhetoric. The criteria, which I've pointed out in bullet points above, should be scrapped and replaced with a general criteria judging rhetorical prowess. By rhetorical prowess, I mean the combination of responsible, verifiable reporting and a creative delivery to create a compelling argument. If attitudes towards formal writing shift towards creativity, English literacy will only grow.</p>

											<h4>Philosophy in Primary Schools</h4>
											<h5>Should Philosophy be taught in High Schools?</h5>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://www.philosophybasics.com/general_whatis.html">Philosophy:</a> The study of knowledge. As Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans put it in Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide: "Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language."</p>
										<p>I'm sorry, I have to borrow definitions because I have a hard time making my own. It's a difficult subject to even consider as part of our education, or even our lives.</p>
										<p>Well, the fact that that's true is the main point of this essay. We'll start with a personal story of mine:</p>
										<p>I wasn't part of the International Baccalaureate program at my high school, but my friends certainly was. One of the requirements for the special high school diploma was enrolling and passing a class called "Theory of Knowledge," exclusive to IB "candidates", or students on the curriculum. It's kind of self-explanatory from the title, but you can still be confused. My definition is that, from what I've heard from my friends, the class consisted of discussions regarding <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/">epistemology</a>, belief, and the defining of the human relationship with information. The class was reading and writing-intensive, and a core aspect of the class was debates and discussions among students about the topic and their takes on it.</p>
										<p>I've never had any formal education in epistemology or philosophy as a whole; I still have not. However, just a slight glimpse into the world of philosophy and I've already figured that this is not a subject enough students are exposed to.</p>
										<p>To be completely honest, I wouldn't expect such a class either. In the American class environment consisting of mindless work and constant studying, there seems to be no room for an interactive experience that could potentially lead its students to question why such mindless work and arduous studying even matter. What I'm saying is, students are so distracted with their workload, that they don't care for nurturing their wisdom, healthy dissent, and life values.</p>
										<p>I suppose that's the point right there, isn't it? I am speaking about philosophy mainly from a critic's perspective. The whole point of philosophy is to question why things are the way things are. partaking in philosophical discourse, whether by oneself or with others, reveal hidden facts and issues about themselves and the society they are a part of. Through reflection, people can better themselves and better others.</p>
										<p>The International Baccalaureate knew the importance of such an investment into a Theory of Knowledge class. The payout of such a class cannot be displayed by numbers or concrete data. However, the IB program understood the need for more self-reflection as a productive member of society. I'm not for adding classes such as "Theory of Knowledge" as a core class. Clearly not everybody will be invested in the philosophical discourse in their high school. However, I believe that a philosophical class as an elective will increase students' exposure to the subject. Alongside their studies, students should have a mindset to question the nature of their education.</p>

											<h4>A Tale of Notes</h4>
											<h5>Ow, my hand hurts from writing too many notes. Maybe that's a good thing.</h5>
										</header>
										<p>No, I'm not advocating for finger arthritis. I'm talking about how better handwritten notes are for the purposes of, uh, note-taking, than typewritten notes.</p>
										<p>So sit down and listen up, because I'm here to tell you a story. Turn on some music; I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D8mCVmRJ1M">this one.</a></p>
										<p>There are two people in this fine tale: Mike and Jenna. I will be Mike. I will also be Jenna. I have to act as both characters because I can't afford an actor.<p>
										<p>Now, Mike had a sweet, clean laptop that had a touchscreen and was also a transformer. He took it to his Physics class, 11 in the morning. He sat down inside the expansive lecture hall. Next to Mike, Jenna had an old-fashioned notebook, a mechanical pencil, and an eraser on her desk. She did have a laptop, but why didn't she bring it out for taking notes?</p>
										<p>Mike asked that exact question, and Jenna claimed that taking handwritten notes is better for retaining information than taking typewritten notes. Mike got that vague feeling that what she's saying sounds true, but he didn't want to believe it. Plus, this was ruining his faith in his transformer laptop. He took a deep breath, trying to stop his trembling legs, wiped the sweat off his palms, and practically yelled at her, "PROVE IT."</p>
										<p>Jenna wiped Mike's shout-spit off her face (with a less-than-amused expression), brought out her laptop, and showed Mike <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away">this article.</a></p>
										<p>"'When people type their notes, they have this tendency to try to take verbatim notes and write down as much of the lecture as they can,' Mueller tells NPR's Rachel Martin. 'The students who were taking longhand notes in our studies were forced to be more selective — because you can't write as fast as you can type. And that extra processing of the material that they were doing benefited them.'" Jenna read out an excerpt from her source.</p>
										<p>Not NPR, Mike thought to himself, sweating underneath the pressure.</p>
										<p>"Also, this too." Jenna switched to <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/take-notes-by-hand-for-better-long-term-comprehension.html">another article.</a></p>
										<p>"They say that 'It may be that longhand note takers engage in more processing than laptop note takers, thus selecting more important information to include in their notes, which enables them to study this content more efficiently.'" Jenn points out an excerpt from her second source. "It says pretty much the same thing as the first article." She added.</p>
										<p>Mike flashed back to the days of his youth; all his time taking notes with pencil and paper. His classmates would always make fun of him, showing off their brand new laptops. "Note-taking machines," they would call them. When he finally got his transformer laptop, he thought he would make up for all those years of his self-confidence crushed by the weight of rich kids and their fancy toys. And now because of this person, Mike's glass castle was starting to show some cracks.</p>
										<p>He pulled out one of his argument cards; "I need scientific studies!" Mike said in a facade of confidence. Jenna nodded and reads an excerpt from the first article. "In the study published in Psychological Science, Pam A. Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer of the University of California, Los Angeles sought to test how note-taking by hand or by computer affects learning." Jenna read out, then describes how the study involved university students in two groups: Those who typed their notes, and those who wrote their notes. "For questions that asked students to simply remember facts, like dates, both groups did equally well. But for 'conceptual-application' questions...the laptop users did 'significantly worse.'"</p>
										<p>Reputable sources, scientific studies, this person has every angle covered, Mike thought. His glass castle has shattered, and Mike sat there, his entire prior ideology completely destroyed. To Mike, it felt like everything he's ever known has been proven wrong; he didn't recognize this world anymore, and he could feel his mind receding into insanity. Legible language was disappearing from his mind; his consciousness becoming utter soup-</p>
										<p>"Hey, are you in a trance?" Jenna tapped Mike's shoulder, who then jumped in his seat. He turned to Jenna with the face of utter defeat and isolation. "I don't know what to think anymore," Mike admitted, "all my life I've thought a computer would help me with my studies more than handwriting my notes. I guess my whole life has been a lie." Mike began to tear up, while Jenna stared at him with a raised eyebrow, perplexed at Mike's entirely self-made dilemma.</p>
										<p>"You...Do know that your laptop has a stylus, right?" Jenna said. At that moment, Mike flashed back to the past, when he first bought his transformer laptop. It had a touchscreen and a stylus so that he could handwrite in the computer. Back then, Mike disregarded the feature and the knowledge was lost to the abyss of his mind. Little did he know that the lost knowledge would come back to him after weeks of it being forgotten. In Mike's eyes, redemption flickered. He brought out the stylus from side port of the laptop. The flicker of redemption became a full-blown blaze of glory, and Mike felt totally in control over his destiny.</p>
										<p>Jenna, meanwhile, has moved a few seats away from Mike because he started spontaneously yelling "YEAHHHHH" in the auditorium, holding up his stylus in triumphant glory.</p>
										<p>So goes the tale of Mike and Jenna, and how the old-fashioned art of handwritten note-taking is superior to typewritten notes for retaining memories and grasping concepts (essentially the entirety of learning). For those of you with styluses and transformer laptops, you have the best of both worlds; appreciate it. For everybody else, embrace your paper notebooks, pencils, and pens. If you still want to type out your notes, you must've skipped the whole story. Go back and read it. Now go, I say to thee! Tell others of the good word and share the tale.</p>
										<p>Oh, and as a side note, if your wrist starts to hurt after writing a bit, stop using just your wrist. Use your arm as well, it helps.</p>
