											<h3>Newsletter 1:</h3>
											<h4>Formality VS. Creativity</h4>
											<h5>People seem to believe that Formal and Creative writing are strict opposites.</h5>
										</header>
										<p>You know the pains of a high school English class. No, I’m not talking about the books we read; I’m talking about the responses we write: Essays, long-form, and likewise. This will most likely sound very familiar to you:</p>
										<ul>Third-person point of view only</ul>
                    <ul>Upmost formality, no informal diction</ul>
										<p>This set of English essay requirements was created with the prospect of teaching general students, going for any possible career path, how to write formal text. However, it doesn't take long for the students, whether writing the essay or reading it, to realize that this strict criteria is fairly lacking.</p>
										<p>The essays you write after the analysis of a text will almost always fall under the guise of Rhetoric, the art of persuasion. That makes sense, as the objective of these analytical essays are meant to persuade the reader of a standpoint of the text's theme. However, this objective cannot be accomplished through formality alone. Indeed, there must be a separation of the work from the creator. However, essays require another, deeper aspect that reflects the author and humanizes the viewpoint. This opens up the pathway that connects the text to the audience; through this, the audience is able to understand the text and accept the discussion.</p>
										<p>Most of the essays I've written in primary school required me to follow the criteria written above. At the time, I believed that this was the standard...Well, I believed it, grudgingly. Despite the positive grades (through following the criteria), these essays were lackluster.</p>
										<p>College, at first, was a shock, where writing took on a different approach. That different approach is a greater emphasis in the personalization of the essay. Much more than the regurgitation of information to pave a path, the criteria in college emphasize on the need to reflect on the information on a deeper level and develop real-world applicable theories supported by the text in focus. The rules are far more lenient, and one is able to speak in first-person, implement jokes and stylistic choices, and grab the engagement of the audience.</p>
										<p>I believe that there should be a fundamental shift in the way the high school English curriculum judge their students' essays. Not only to cultivate formality and accountability, the criteria should also account for an identifiable voice which builds upon the rhetorical effectiveness of the text. The common criteria of high school essay-writing leave this personalization out of focus, and that staunch formality restricts choices for greater rhetorical prowess. High school essays lack a human voice. Once again, people may argue for the formal criteria as the best means of raising general English literacy. I argue that formality and creativity do not have to be opposites; they should complement each other. The current method stifles innovation in English literacy and rhetoric. The criteria, which I've pointed out in bullet points above, should be scrapped and replaced with a general criteria judging rhetorical prowess. By rhetorical prowess, I mean the combination of responsible, verifiable reporting and a creative delivery to create a compelling argument. If attitudes towards formal writing shift towards creativity, English literacy will only grow.</p>
